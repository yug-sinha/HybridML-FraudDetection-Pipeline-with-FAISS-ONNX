# Fraud Detection & Monitoring System

This project is an end-to-end fraud detection and monitoring system built as a multi-phase prototype. It demonstrates advanced data simulation, feature engineering, hybrid model integration, distributed vector search, real-time alerting, explainable AI, and enterprise-grade security & compliance—all integrated into a full-stack solution with a frontend dashboard.

## Overview

The project is divided into several phases:

- **Phase 1: Data Preparation & Multi-Modal Feature Engineering**  
  - Simulate a massive transaction dataset (using Faker, GANs, and RL agents).
  - Extract text and structured features via tokenization, NER, embeddings (Word2Vec, AutoEncoders, PCA, t-SNE).

- **Phase 2: Hybrid Embedding Generation & Multi-LLM Integration**  
  - Fine-tune FinBERT and use contrastive learning (SimCSE-like) to generate transaction embeddings.
  - Integrate multiple models (FinBERT for categorization, T5 for summarization, a simplified RL agent) for fraud scoring.
  - Export models for GPU acceleration via ONNX.

- **Phase 3: Distributed Vector Search & Real-Time Detection**  
  - Build FAISS indexes for cosine similarity and L2 distance.
  - Demonstrate fast ANN search with quantization (with fallback when training data is insufficient).
  - Simulate multi-threaded real-time detection and distributed index updates.

- **Phase 4: Full Pipeline Development & Rule-Based Anomaly Detection**  
  - Implement an end-to-end pipeline using Dask for parallel processing.
  - Simulate streaming transactions, process them through ETL, embedding generation, vector search, fraud scoring, and alerting.
  - Integrate Explainable AI (using SHAP) for model interpretability.

- **Phase 5: Real-Time Monitoring & High-Performance Alert System**  
  - Build a real-time alerting system with FastAPI that triggers alerts via WebSockets, logs anomalies in Elasticsearch, updates Prometheus metrics, and sends SMS alerts via Twilio.
  - Implement a human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism to adjust fraud thresholds (simulated RLHF with Bayesian optimization).

- **Phase 6: Enterprise-Grade Security & Compliance**  
  - Implement multi-layered security with AES-256 encryption, OAuth2/JWT authentication, and Cloud KMS simulation.
  - Ensure regulatory compliance (PCI-DSS, GDPR, KYC) via audit logging (immutable ledger) and a "Right to be Forgotten" API.

- **Phase 7: Frontend Dashboard & API Development**  
  - Develop a full-stack fintech dashboard using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts.
  - Expose both REST and GraphQL endpoints for real-time fraud detection.
  - The dashboard shows live fraud monitoring, transaction heatmaps, and alert logs.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Install Node.js v18 or above (using nvm is recommended).
- **Python:** Python 3.10+ (with a virtual environment recommended).
- **Git:** For version control.

### Installing Python Dependencies

Activate your virtual environment (if not already activated):

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-jose[cryptography] cryptography pydantic elasticsearch prometheus_client twilio dask shap faiss-cpu
```

### Installing Frontend Dependencies

Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If using Tailwind CSS, ensure your configuration files are set up (refer to `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`).

## Running the Project

### Phase 1 - Data Simulation & Feature Engineering

Run the script (this generates synthetic data and performs feature engineering):

```bash
python phase-1-2.py
```

### Phase 2 - Embedding Generation & Multi-LLM Integration

Run the script:

```bash
python phase-2.py
```

### Phase 3 - Distributed Vector Search & Real-Time Detection

Run the script:

```bash
python phase-3.py
```

### Phase 4 - Full Pipeline & Anomaly Detection

Run the pipeline simulation:

```bash
python phase-4.py
```

### Phase 5 - Real-Time Monitoring & Alert System

Run the FastAPI server:

```bash
python phase-5.py
```

Test endpoints (e.g., `/simulate_stream`, `/trigger_alert`, etc.) via Postman or your browser.

### Phase 6 - Enterprise-Grade Security & Compliance

Run the FastAPI server for security endpoints:

```bash
python phase-6.py
```

Test endpoints:
- `/token` for authentication.
- `/secure_data` to retrieve encrypted data.
- `/right_to_be_forgotten/{user_id}` for GDPR deletion.
- `/audit_log` to view audit logs.

### Phase 7 - Frontend Dashboard & API Development

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dashboard.

## Testing & Development

- **API Testing:** Use Postman or curl to test REST endpoints.
- **GraphQL Testing:** Use a GraphQL client (or the built-in GraphQL playground at `/graphql`).
- **Frontend:** The Next.js dashboard displays live data from your backend APIs. Adjust components as needed.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Connect via WebSockets (e.g., at `/ws/alerts`) to receive real-time notifications.
- **Monitoring:** Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor metrics from the `/metrics` endpoint.

## Notes & Future Enhancements

- **Scaling:** For production, integrate with distributed processing (e.g., PySpark) and managed services for vector search (e.g., Pinecone).
- **Security:** Harden OAuth2/JWT authentication, use a proper Cloud KMS for key management, and secure all endpoints.
- **Compliance:** Enhance audit logging and build robust APIs for regulatory compliance.
- **Frontend:** Expand the dashboard with more detailed visualizations (transaction heatmaps, alert logs) and interactivity.
- **CI/CD:** Set up automated testing and deployment pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions or Jenkins).
