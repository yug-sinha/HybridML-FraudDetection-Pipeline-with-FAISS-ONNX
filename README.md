# Fraud Detection System with LLM Embeddings and Transformer Models

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust fraud detection system leveraging Language Model (LLM) embeddings and Transformer models. It integrates advanced techniques for anomaly detection, multi-modal feature engineering, and real-time monitoring to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in financial transactions.

## Phases and Components

### Phase 1: Data Preparation & Multi-Modal Feature Engineering
- **1.1 Simulating a Massive Transaction Dataset**
  - Generated diverse transactions using ChatGPT-4, Faker.js, and GANs.
  - Simulated evolving fraud tactics with reinforcement learning agents.
  - Applied adversarial noise for model robustness.

- **1.2 Multi-Modal Feature Engineering**
  - Extracted text-based features using SentencePiece and Tiktoken.
  - Applied Named Entity Recognition (NER) for merchant & product classification.
  - Generated structured embeddings using AutoEncoders, PCA, and t-SNE.

### Phase 2: Hybrid Embedding Generation & Multi-LLM Integration
- **2.1 Generate Transaction Embeddings**
  - Compared embeddings including BERT-based (FinBERT, RoBERTa), GPT-4, and GNN.
  - Fine-tuned models and enhanced separability using Contrastive Learning (SimCSE).
  - Stored embeddings in HDF5, Parquet, or Vector DB for scalability.

- **2.2 Integrate Multi-LLM Fraud Scoring**
  - Implemented GPT-4 for contextual anomaly detection, FinBERT for merchant categorization, and T5-based models for transaction summarization.
  - Utilized reinforcement learning agents for adaptive fraud scoring.
  - Deployed models with ONNX and TensorRT for GPU acceleration.

### Phase 3: Distributed Vector Search & Real-Time Detection
- **3.1 Set Up Distributed Vector Database**
  - Utilized FAISS, Annoy, ScaNN, or Pinecone for high-speed vector search.
  - Parallelized index updates with Kafka Streams and implemented HNSW index.

- **3.2 Implement High-Speed Similarity Search**
  - Retrieved nearest neighbors using cosine similarity and L2 distance.
  - Optimized search latency to sub-10ms with quantization and multi-threaded queries.

### Phase 4: Full Pipeline Development & Rule-Based Anomaly Detection
- **4.1 Build an End-to-End Fraud Detection Pipeline**
  - Architected pipeline from Kafka/RabbitMQ to ETL Preprocessing, Embedding Generation, Vector Search, Fraud Scoring, and Alert System.
  - Implemented real-time feature engineering with Kafka Streams.

- **4.2 Implement Explainable AI (XAI)**
  - Used SHAP and LIME for model predictions explanation.
  - Generated human-readable fraud explanations and interpretability dashboards.

### Phase 5: Real-Time Monitoring & High-Performance Alert System
- **5.1 Implement Fraud Alert & Notification System**
  - Triggered alerts via WebSockets, Push Notifications, and logged anomalies in Elasticsearch/Kibana.
  - Set up Prometheus and Grafana for real-time dashboards and used Twilio API for SMS alerts.

- **5.2 Implement Feedback Learning Loop**
  - Incorporated RLHF for reinforcement learning with human feedback.
  - Optimized fraud threshold tuning using Bayesian Optimization.

### Phase 6: Enterprise-Grade Security & Compliance
- **6.1 Implement Multi-Layered Security**
  - Ensured AES-256 encryption for sensitive data and OAuth2/JWT authentication.
  - Used Cloud KMS for secure key storage and maintained regulatory compliance with PCI-DSS, GDPR, and KYC requirements.

- **6.2 Ensure Regulatory Compliance**
  - Implemented audit logging with immutable ledgers and built "Right to be Forgotten" API for GDPR compliance.

### Phase 7: Frontend Dashboard & API Development
- **7.1 Build a Full-Stack Fintech Dashboard**
  - Developed interactive Web UI with Next.js, Tailwind, Recharts, and GraphQL APIs.
  - Included live fraud monitoring, transaction heatmaps, and alert logs.

- **7.2 Develop Fraud Detection API**
  - Exposed REST and GraphQL APIs for real-time transaction fraud detection using FastAPI with async support.

### Phase 8: Testing, Deployment & CI/CD Automation
- **8.1 Develop an Enterprise-Grade Test Suite**
  - Conducted Unit, Integration, and Load Testing with pytest-benchmark, K6, and Locust.
  - Simulated infrastructure failures with Chaos Testing using Gremlin.

- **8.2 Deploy to Production on Cloud**
  - Utilized Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) for autoscaling and deployed models with TorchServe and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server.
  - Implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions/Jenkins and Blue-Green Deployment for zero downtime.
